ðŸš€ Just completed an exciting ELT data pipeline project focused on eCommerce data! This end-to-end pipeline extracts sales data, stages it for further analysis, and transforms it into actionable insights in a data warehouse.

Key languages and data platforms of the project:

- Python and custom scripts were used to extract and load eCommerce data efficiently from CSV files and MySQL databases.
- PostgreSQL served as the staging area and the final data warehouse, handling structured sales data.
- Apache Airflow orchestrated the entire workflow, ensuring smooth operations from extraction to transformation.
- Containerized the project using Docker for seamless environment management and consistent deployment.
- Power BI provided the final layer of visualization, offering insightful sales analytics and business intelligence.
